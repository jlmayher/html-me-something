            <h2>Isn't a story just a series of events?</h2>
            <p>Stories are not merely a string of events. Stories have 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_structure">structure</a> and elements that make them distinct from a simple description
                 of things that happened. The events of a story are woven together in a such a way that tension is built up during the beginning and middle
                with a rapid decrease in the amount of tension after the climax and denouement. </p>

                <h1>A Thanksgiving Day Hike</h1>
                <p>On Thanksgiving Day in 2016, my husband, Philip, and I decided to have breakfast by Shady Lake in <a href=https://mostateparks.com/park/cuivre-river-state-park>Cuivre River State Park</a>.  The afternoon was full of family events, so we thought it would be nice to go for a hike and have breakfast with just the two of us at one of our favorite spots. It was going to be tight time-wise since it would be about 3 hours for the hike and breakfast and we had to be back in time for showers before heading off to my in-laws's; for late lunch.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The weather was a bit wet that morning, but the park was so peaceful that it just added to the ambience. We didn't pass another person in the mile and a half down the <a href=https://mostateparks.com/sites/mostateparks/files/trail_maps/cuivre_longspring_0.pdf>Lone Spring Trail </a> to Shady 80 Lake.  It was in the 40s that day, perfect weather for a fall hike. There were deer and a few squirrels out and about, but not people. I guess everyone was back at home with their families, leaving us to enjoy the scene undisturbed. </p>
                <p>When we got to the lake we set about making breakfast. Philip got out the stove and we put water on to boil while I readied the food packages for prep. We picked out our favorite freeze-dried breakfast meal, <a href=https://www.mountainhouse.com/m/product/scrambled-eggs-ham.html?variant_id=85> Mountain House Scrambled Eggs with Ham and Peppers</a> for that morning because it would be quick and easy to prepare and didn’t require lugging complex cooking apparatus with us. Just a pot, two bowls, a small stove and white gas canister were all we needed.</p>
                <p>Originally, our plan was to hike all 5.2 miles plus the half-mile round trip to the lake, but, like many other people, we had afternoon plans for dinner with family and had to take a connector to cut a mile and a half off of the trail. We enjoyed our holiday hike so much we went to <a href="https://mostateparks.com/park/castlewood-state-park">Castlewood State Park</a> for New Year's Eve.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="free">

                    <p id="beginning">I was at <a href="http://www.nicksbq.com/">Nick&apos;s Bar-B-Q and Catfish</a> in 
                    Carlyle, Arkansas with my parents and 
                    brother. Everytime we go down to visit family and friends we stop at Nick&apos;s
                    in Mom&apos;s home town. They have the best fried catfish you can find anywhere, and
                    you can top off your dinner with a fried pie. I'm nearly willing to drive 7 hours
                    down there just to have some of that catfish. 
                    My family had just finished eating and were waiting up front to pay. I said to my 
                    mother,</br>
                    "I&apos;m going to the restroom. 
                    Don&apos;t leave without me."</p>
                    
                </div>
                <p class="explain">This is the beginning of the story. Here we introduce our setting and characters. 
                        We end the beginning with the event that causes the rise in tension.</p>
            </br>
                <div id="middle">
                    <p> When I came out of the restroom, my family was gone. 
                    I thought to myself "Not a big deal. They&apos;re probably 
                    just waiting outside." I went outside, looked around, 
                    and didn't see them. Then, I saw them. Dad was driving 
                    down the road in the truck, My mother and brother we 
                    just leaving the parking lot in the car. Crap. </p>
                    <p>I ran through the parking lot, heedless of the cars 
                    driving through. The only thing I could think was that 
                    I had to get Mom's attention or be stuck here. 
                    Unfortunately for me, she didn't notice me jumping up 
                    and down in the road in her rear-view mirror, and continued 
                    to drive off to my grandmother's house.</p>
                    <p>Now I was worried. This was long enough ago that we didn't 
                    have cell phones that worked out of state, and the phone 
                    service to my grandmother's house had been turned off 
                    when she moved to the assisted-care facility. I really 
                    didn&apos;t know who to call. Our cousin lived next door to 
                    grandma&apos;s house, but even though I&apos;d know her my entire 
                    life, I had no idea what her last name was (Thomas, I 
                    found out later it was Thomas).
                    I slumped onto the bench in front of Nick&apos;s trying to 
                    decide if I should ask someone there for a ride out 
                    to my grandmother&apos;s house or try to walk the several 
                    miles there. Could I call the police? I was an adult, 
                    not a lost child. What would they say? Just as I was about to walk inside 
                    and talk to someone, a familiar looking 1994 Chrysler 
                    New Yorker pulled up, rolled down the window and from 
                    inside someone called, </p>
                    <p id="climax">"Need a ride somewhere?"</p>
                   
                </div>
                <p class="explain">Through the middle section the tension rises as the protagonist
                        encounters a series of obstacles to reuniting with her family.</p>
                <div id="end">
                    <p id="denouement">It was my mother! I was saved from having to ask a 
                    total stranger for help because I didn&apos;t know my own 
                    cousin&apos;s last name. I very nearly fainted from relief.
                    It turned out that both of my parents assumed I was 
                    riding with the other and the only reason Mom returned 
                    was that my brother saw me jumping up and down in the 
                    road and asked Mom who I was riding with. When she 
                    told him I was with Dad, he said,</p>
                    <p>"If she&apos;s riding with Dad, then why is she jumping up and down in the road behind us?"</p>
                    <p>One would think this was the last time my parents nearly left me alone in a place
                    far from home, but not everone learns their lesson quickly. It wasn&apos;t until Dad tried to 
                    drive off while I was actually getting into the car in Washington, DC that they started paying more
                    attention.
                    
                </div>
                <p class="explain">In the end of the story, we have the denouement where the resolution to 
                        the story arc is explained.</p>
                <h2>Why is "My Brother to the Rescue" a story and "Thanksgiving Day Hike" is not?</h2>
                        <p>Without a buildup of tension and the resolution of the tension after the climax, Thanksgiving Day Hike just relates
                            a series of events. However, by constructing a narrative arc "My Brother to the Rescue" tells a story of the 
                            protagonist being left behind by her family, the tension builds as she considers whether she has
                            any way to contact them or will she be left waiting and finally the resolution occurs when her mother and brother return to the
                            restaurant to retrieve her.</p>
                    <p>The structure creates a story out of a series of events</p>
