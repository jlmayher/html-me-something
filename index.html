        <h1>What is a story?</h1>
            <p>Stories are not merely a string of events. Stories have 
                elements that make them distinct from a simple description
                 of things that happened. Usually, stories have certain features.</p>

        <h1>My Brother to the Rescue</h1>
            <p>I was at Nick's Bar-B-Que and Catfish in 
                Carlyle, Arkansas with my parents and 
                brother. We had just finished eating and 
                were waiting up front to pay. I said to my 
                mother,</p>
            <p>"I'm going to the restroom. 
                Don't leave without me."</p>
            <p>When I came out of the restroom, my family was gone. 
                I thought to myself "Not a big deal. They're probably 
                just waiting outside." I went outside, looked arounnd, 
                and didn't see them. Then, I saw them. Dad was driving 
                down the road in the truck, My mother and brother we 
                just leaving the parking lot in the car. Crap. </p>
            <p>I ran through the parking lot, heedless of the cars 
                driving through. The only thing I could think was that 
                I had to get Mom's attention or be stuck here. 
                Unfortunately for me, she didn't notice me jumping up 
                and down in the road in her rear-view mirror, and continued 
                to drive off to my grandmother's house.</p>
            <p>Now I was worried. This was long enough ago that we didn't 
                have cell phones that worked out of state, and the phone 
                service to my grandmother's house had been turned off 
                when she moved to the assisted-care facility. I really 
                didn't know who to call. Our cousin lived next door to 
                grandma's house, but even though I'd know her my entire 
                life, I had no idea what her last name was (Thomas, I 
                found out later it was Thomas).</p>
            <p>I slumped onto the bench in front of Nick's trying to 
                decide if I should ask someone there for a ride out 
                to my grandmother's house or try to walk the several 
                miles there. Could I call the police? I was an adult, 
                not a lost child. Just as I was about to walk inside 
                and talk to someone, a familiar looking 1994 Chrysler 
                New Yorker pulled up, rolled down the window and from 
                inside someone called, </p>
            <p>"Need a ride somewhere?"</p>
            <p>It was my mother! I was saved from having to ask a 
                total stranger for help because I didn't know my own 
                cousin's last name. I very nearly fainted from relief.</p>
            <p>It turned out that both of my parents assumed I was 
                riding with the other and the only reason Mom returned 
                was that my brother saw me juping up and down in the 
                road and asked our mom who I was riding with. When she 
                told him I was with Dad, he said,</p>
            <p>"If she's riding with Dad, then why is she jumping up and down in the road behind us?"</p>
